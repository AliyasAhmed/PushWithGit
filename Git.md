If you already have files in your project directory and you want to push them to a new GitHub repository, you can still follow a similar process. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Steps to Push Existing Files to GitHub

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Name it `WhatToDo`.
   - **Don't** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (you will handle this locally).

2. **Initialize Git in Your Project Directory**
   Open your terminal or PowerShell in your project directory (`E:\Notes\HTML, CSS, JS\Projects\TodoList_App`).

3. **Run the Following Commands:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "first commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/AliyasAhmed/WhatToDo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   ### Explanation of Each Command:
   - `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in your project directory.
   - `git add .`: Adds all files in the current directory to the staging area.
   - `git commit -m "first commit"`: Commits the files to the repository with the message "first commit".
   - `git branch -M main`: Renames the default branch to `main`.
   - `git remote add origin https://github.com/AliyasAhmed/WhatToDo.git`: Adds the remote repository URL (replace with your repository URL).
   - `git push -u origin main`: Pushes the committed changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.

### Summary

Even if you already have files in your project directory, you can follow these steps to initialize a Git repository, add and commit your existing files, and push them to a new GitHub repository. This process ensures that all your files are uploaded to GitHub.
